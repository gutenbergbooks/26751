<h2><small>By JACK EGAN</small></h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Above</span> him eighty feet of torpid,
black water hung like a
shroud of Death, and still he
heard his ragged breathing. And
something else. Cully concentrated
on that sound, and the
rhythmic pulsing of his heart.
Somehow he had to retain a hold
on his sanity ... or his soul.</p>

<p>After an hour of careful
breathing and exploring of body
sensations, Cully realized he
could move. He flexed an arm; a
mote of gold sand sifted upward
in the dark water. It had a pleasant
color, in contrast with the
ominous shades of the sea. In a
few moments, he had struggled
to a sitting position, delighting
in the curtain of glittering
metal grains whirling around
him as he moved.</p>

<p>And the other sound. A humming
in his mind; a distant burble
of tiny voices of other minds.
Words swirling in giddy patterns
he couldn't understand.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Cully discovered
why he still lived,
breathed: a suit. A yellow, plastic,
water-tight suit, with an orange-on-black
shield on the left
breast pocket, and a clear bubble-helmet.
He felt weight on his
back and examined it: two air
tanks and their regulator, a radio,
and ... the box.</p>

<p>Suit, tanks, regulator; radio,
black water, box; sand, sea, stillness.</p>

<p>Cully considered his world. It
was small; it was conceivable; it
was incomplete.</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>"Where is what?" He knew he
had a voice&mdash;a means of communication
between others of his
kind, using low-frequency heat
waves caused by agitation of air
molecules. Why couldn't he make
it work?</p>

<p>Words. Thousands of them, at
his beck and call. What were
they? What did they mean? He
shifted uncomfortably in the
tight yellow suit, searching the
near horizon for ...</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">A vague</span> calling came from
beyond the black sea curtain.
Objectively, because he
could do nothing to stop them,
he watched his feet pick up,
move forward, put down; pick
up, move forward, put down.
Funny. He had the feeling, the
concept, that this action held
meaning. It was supposed to
cause some reaction, accomplish
an act. He wondered at the regular
movement of his legs. One of
them hurt. A hurt is a sensation
of pain, caused by over-loading
sensory-units in the body; a hurt
is bad, because it indicates something
is wrong.</p>

<p>Something certainly was
wrong. Something stirred in
Cully's mind. He stopped and sat
down on the sandy sea bottom,
gracefully, like a ballet dancer.
He examined his foot. There was
a tiny hole in the yellow plastic
fabric, and a thin string of red-black
was oozing out. Blood. He
knew.</p>

<p>He was bleeding. He could do
nothing about it. He got up and
resumed walking.</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>Cully lifted his head in annoyance
at the sharp thought.</p>

<p>"Go away," he said in a low,
pleading voice. The sound made
him feel better. He began muttering
to himself.</p>

<p>"Water, black, s-sand, hurt.
Pain. Radio tanks ..."</p>

<p>It didn't sound right. After a
few minutes, he was quiet. The
manythoughts were calling him.
He must go to the manythoughts.</p>

<p>If his foot was bleeding, then
something had happened; if
something had happened, then
his foot was bleeding.</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>If something had happened,
then maybe other things had
happened&mdash;before that. But how
could something happen in a
world of flat gold sand and flaccid
sea? Surely there was something
wrong. Wrong: the state
of being not-right; something
had happened that was not-right.
Cully stared at the edges of the
unmoving curtain before him.</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>It was a driving, promise-filled
concept. No words; just the
sense that something wonderful
lay just beyond reach. But this
voice was different from the
manythoughts. It was directing
his body; his mind was along for
the ride.</p>

<p>The sameness of the sea and
sand became unbearable. It was
too-right, somehow. Cully felt
anger, and kicked up eddies of
dust. It changed the sameness a
little. He kicked more up, until
it swirled around him in a thick
gold haze, blotting out the terrible
emptiness of the sea.</p>

<p>He felt another weight at his
side. He found a holster and gun.
He recognized neither. Again he
watched objectively as his hand
pulled the black object out and
handled it. His body was evidently
familiar with it, though
it was strange to his eyes. His
finger slipped automatically into
the trigger sheaf. His legs were
still working under two drives:
the manythoughts' urging, and
something else, buried in him. A
longing. Up-and-down, back-and-forth.</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>Anger, frustration flared in
him. His hand shot out, gun at
ready. He turned around slowly.
Through the settling trail of suspended
sand, nothing was visible.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Again</span> he was moving. Something
made his legs move.
He walked on through the
shrouds of Death until he felt a
taut singing in his nerves. An
irrational fear sprang out in
him, cascading down his spine,
and Cully shuddered. Ahead
there was some<i>thing</i>. Two motives:
get there because it
(they?) calls; get there because
you must.</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>The mind-voice was excited,
demanding. Something was out
there, besides the sameness. Cully
walked on, trailing gold. The
death-curtain parted ...</p>

<p>An undulating garden of blue-and-gold
streamers suddenly
drifted toward him on an unfelt
current. Cully was held, entranced.
They flowed before him,
their colors dazzling, hypnotic.</p>

<p><i>Come closer, Earthling</i>, the
manythoughts spoke inside his
head, soothingly.</p>

<p><i>Here it is!</i> Cully's mind
shouted.</p>

<p>Cully's mind was held, hypnotized,
but his body moved of its
own volition.</p>

<p>He moved again. His mind
and the manythoughts' spoke:
fulfillment&mdash;almost. There was
one action left that must be
completed.</p>

<p>Cully's arms moved. They detached
the small black box from
his pack. He moved on into the
midst of the weaving, gold-laced
plants. Little spicules licked out
from their flexing stalks and
jabbed, unsensed, into Cully's
body to draw nourishment. From
the manythoughts came the sense
of complete fulfillment.</p>

<p>From Cully's mind came further
orders.</p>

<p><i>Lie down.</i> It was a collective
concept. <i>Lie still. We are friends.</i></p>

<p>He could not understand. They
were speaking words; words
were beyond him. His head shook
in despair. The voices were
implanting an emotion of horror
at what his hands were doing,
but he had no control over his
body. It was as if it were not his.</p>

<p>The black box was now lying
in the sand among the streaming
plants. Cully's fingers reached
out and caressed a small panel.
A soundless 'click' ran through
the murkiness. The strangely
beautiful, gold-laced blue plants
began a writhing dance. Their
spicules withdrew and jabbed,
withdrew and jabbed. A rending,
silent scream tore the quiet waters.</p>

<p><i>NO!</i> they cried. It was a negative
command, mixed in with
the terrible screaming. <i>Turn it
off!</i></p>

<p>"Stop it, stop it!" Cully tried
to say, but there were no words.
He tried to cover his ears within
the helmet, but the cries went
on. Emotions roiled the water:
pain, hurt, reproach. Cully
sobbed. Something was wrong
here; something was killing the
plants&mdash;the beautiful blue
things! The plants were withering,
dying. He looked up at them,
stupefied, not understanding,
tears streaming down his face.
What did they want from him?
What had he done ...</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>A different direction materialized;
a new concept of desire.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Cully's</span> body turned and
crawled away from the wonderful,
dying garden, oblivious
to the pleadings floating, now
weakly, in the torpid water. He
scuffed up little motes of golden
sand, leaving a low-lying scud
along the bottom, back to the
little black box in the garden.
The plants, the box, all were forgotten
by now. Cully crawled on,
not knowing why. A rise appeared;
surprise caught Cully unaware.
A change in the sameness!</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>Again the voice was insistent.
His desire was close ahead; he
did not look back at the black
churning on the sea bottom. His
legs worked, his chest heaved,
words swirled in his mind. He
topped the rise.</p>

<p>Below him, in the center of a
shallow golden bowl, floated a
long, shiny cylinder. Even from
here he knew it was huge. He
knew other things about it: how
heavy it was; how it was; that
it carried others of his kind. He
had been in it before. And they
were waiting for him. He
lurched on.</p>

<p>"Captain! Here comes Cully!"
the midshipman shouted from
the airlock. "Look what they've
done to him!"</p>

<p>The old man's grey eyes took
in the spectacle without visible
emotion. He watched the pathetic,
bleeding yellow plastic sack
crawl up to the ship and look up.
His hands reached down and
lifted Cully up into the lock.</p>

<p>They took his suit off and
stared with loathing at what had
once been a man. A white scar
zig-zagged across his forehead.
The Captain bent close, in range
of the dim blue eyes.</p>

<p>"It was a brave thing you did,
Cully. The whole system will be
grateful. Venus could never be
colonized as long as those cannibals
were there to eat men, and
drive men mad." Cully fingered
the scar on his forehead, and
looked unseeing into the old
man's compassionate eyes. "I'm
sorry Cully. We all are. But there
was no other way. Prefrontal
lobotomy, destruction of your
speech center ... it was the
only way you could get past the
telepaths and destroy them. I'm
sorry, Cully. The race of Man
shall long honor your name."</p>

<p>Cully smiled at the old man,
the words churning in his brain;
but he did not understand.</p>

<p><i>Where is it?</i></p>

<p>The emptiness was still there.</p>
